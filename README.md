# AutoCare

## Overview

AutoCare is a web-based vehicle service system designed to save busy people time by facilitating vehicle maintenance. The platform connects three main parties: Customers (vehicle owners), Drivers, and Service Centers.

## Features

- **Customer Service**: Customers can sign up, choose a service station, select service categories (e.g., body wash, full service), and book trusted drivers. They can track their vehicle's journey and service updates via SMS and maps.
- **Driver Management**: Drivers sign up with verified details and get notified when a booking is made. They are responsible for safely transporting the vehicle to and from the service center, updating service progress, and ensuring customer satisfaction.
